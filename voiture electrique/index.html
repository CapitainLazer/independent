  <h1>Gironde, d√©partement of Nouvelle Aquitaine: An area of sustainable development </h1><br><br>
  <p class="pos_text">
    New Aquitaine is one of the French regions with the highest number of English households, but it is also an area of
    ecological and economic progress, thanks in particular to the energy transition plan launched on 9 July 2019 by the
    New Aquitaine region, which promotes sustainable modes of transport and is committed to a greener future.
    <br>
    To understand how the proportion of electric cars has changed in relation to the number of electric charging points,
    we have selected a set of 15 communes ranging from the smallest to the largest in the region.
    <br><br>

  <h2>Electric cars, a new face on the automotive landscape.</h2>
  <br><br>
  <p class="pos_text">
    With the arrival of electric cars, we can see a certain increase in the number of electric personal vehicles in
    relation to the total number of personal vehicles.<br>
    We can already see a trend since 2020 using some basic percentage calculations, with electric vehicles (blue)
    representing just 0.07% of total vehicles (red), but today in 2024, 1.47% of personal vehicles in this region are
    electric vehicles, so we estimate a stable average annual growth rate of around 1.40% more electric cars per year.
    <br>
    <br>
    We use a scale of 1/1,000,000.<br>

  <h2>
  Charging stations, a major challenge to meet growing needs.</h2>
  <p class="pos_text"><br>
    To keep pace with these measures, it is crucial to set up charging stations across the region to keep pace with the
    growing number of electric vehicles, and to meet the needs of users. In theory, the department needs 1 charging
    station for every 10 cars, but when we look at the department's data, we quickly see that the ratio of charging
    stations to electric cars, which should be 1 for every 10 cars, quickly rises to over 1 for every 1,000 vehicles
    after a slight calculation of the totals.
  </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2> Is the number of charging points linked to the number of vehicles?</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="pos_text">
    A closer look reveals that as the number of cars increases, so does the number of chargepoints. To verify this
    hypothesis, we're looking for a correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient is 0.71, which is very close to
    1, so it's safe to say that as the number of electric cars increases, so will the number of charging points.
